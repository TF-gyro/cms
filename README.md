# **Gyro CMS**

Based on the work of [Junction](https://github.com/tribe-framework/junction)

**Gyro CMS** is a ready-to-go Content Management System (CMS) for **TrueArch**.
It provides a comprehensive interface to manage the entire TrueArch ecosystem — from backend structure to actual content — allowing you to quickly plan, configure, and deploy backend services with ease.
